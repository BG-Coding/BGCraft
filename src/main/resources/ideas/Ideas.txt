Blargh.

- Maybe implement other power systems
- Pizza oven (nom nom)
    - multiblock (bricks, maybe some special heat resistant brick)
        - firebrick item done (needs texture)
    - either 3x3x3 or 3x4x3 (1 block for actual fire)
    - uses coal, yaay

    added a pizzaoven concept picture, thought of a shape like that with a fire that burns when you put coal/wood in it,
    throw items next too it, they cook and get thrown out the front when they're done

- Basic machines
    - Furnace
    - ore doubling (maybe very expensive method to x3 or x4)
    - item pipes?
    - Conveyor belts that take power. Belt consists of blocks and power comes from some kind of engine. Items lay in belt ridges.
    - Vacuum pipe that sucks items from belt. <--- ^: see mechanic suggestion.png BlackyApproves.png
